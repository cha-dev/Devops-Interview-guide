#### Linux Interview Quick Guide ####

1. Find and remove the log folders that are older than 7 days in the /var/log directory

find /var/log -type f -name "*.log"

find /var/log -type f -name "*.log" -exec rm {} \;

find /var/log -type f -name "*.log" -mtime +7 -exec rm {} \;

2. Your application writes logs to /var/log/myapp. You want to:
   1. Compress the logs older than 7 days
   2. Delete the logs older than 30 days
   3. Automate it via a daily cron job

3. Service health Monitor script
   1. services=("nginx" "sshd" "docker")
     refer monitor_services.sh
4. Find and delete files over 100MB
   find /path/to/directory -type f -size +100M

   find /path/to/directory -type f -size +100M -exec rm -f {} \;

5. How do you remove the first and last line of a file using sed?
   This task checks your understanding of line-addressing in sed, which is a powerful stream editor used in shell scripting for text manipulation.

  sed '1d; $d' filename.txt
 sed: Stream editor used to process text line-by-line.
'1d': Deletes the first line (1 = line number).
'$d': Deletes the last line ($ = end of file).
 filename.txt: The file to be processed.
   sed '1d; $d' file.txt > trimmed.txt

6. How do you get the list of users who logged into the system today?
   last | grep "$(date '+%a %b %e')" | awk '{print $1}' | sort | uniq

      last: Displays recent login history from /var/log/wtmp.
date '+%a %b %e':
Outputs todayâ€™s date in the format used by last, e.g., Thu Jun 13.
%a = abbreviated weekday, %b = abbreviated month, %e = day of month (with space-padding).
grep "$(date ...)": Filters only login entries for today.
awk '{print $1}': Extracts the usernames from the matched lines.
sort | uniq: Removes duplicates to show unique users who logged in today.
